# Mathdown
(Click on the file icon, top left, to get started with a **new document**.)
## Mathdown takes simple Markdown syntax
### and MathJax for $\LaTeX$ equations
#### And Firepad for REAL-TIME collaboration
#####  So you can do, together,

a) _italics_ with underscores (`_`)
b) **boldface** with asterisks (`*`) 
c) `literals` with backticks (`_`)
d) dollars signs (`ï¼„`) for math with $\LaTeX$

and _stuff_ like $H_2O$, and this:
$$P=\int X\ dx=\frac{\mu}{\epsilon}V^{2}\left\{ \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{v}{V}\right)^{2}}}-1\right\}$$

_(To edit a formula just move into it.)_
